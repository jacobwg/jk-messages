		# Helper Functions

		# Get the prepared site/document title
		# Often we would like to specify particular formatting to our page's title
		# we can apply that formatting here
		getPreparedTitle: ->
			# if we have a document title, then we should use that and suffix the site's title onto it
			if @document.title
				"#{@document.title} | #{@site.title}"
			# if our document does not have it's own title, then we should just use the site's title
			else

	# DocPad Events

	# Here we can define handlers for events that DocPad fires
	# You can find a full listing of events on the DocPad Wiki
	events:

		# Server Extend
		# Used to add our own custom routes to the server before the docpad routes are added
		serverExtend: (opts) ->
			# Extract the server from the options
			{server} = opts
			docpad = @docpad

			# As we are now running in an event,
			# ensure we are using the latest copy of the docpad configuraiton
			# and fetch our urls from it
			latestConfig = docpad.getConfig()
			oldUrls = latestConfig.templateData.site.oldUrls or []
			newUrl = latestConfig.templateData.site.url

			# Redirect any requests accessing one of our sites oldUrls to the new site url
			server.use (req,res,next) ->
				if req.headers.host in oldUrls
					res.redirect(newUrl+req.url, 301)
				else
					next()
}
